A metamorphic pressure vs. temperature plot shows the locations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_facies" target="_blank">metamorphic facies</a> within pressure-temperature space. Individual facies are defined by specific mineralogical assemblages, which are consistent throughout a given facies.

Metamorphic facies were first introduced by Finnish geologist <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/eskola-pentti-elias" target="_blank">Pentti Eskola</a> in 1920. <a href="http://foreninger.uio.no/ngf/ngt/pdfs/NGT_06_1&2_143-194.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to read his original manuscript.</a> These were later expanded on by New Zealand geologist and UC Berkeley professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_John_Turner" target="_blank">Francis John Turner</a>.

Below is a typical metamorphic facies diagram.
